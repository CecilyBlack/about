## Lattice

We use [Lattice](https://sourcegraph.latticehq.com/login?message=session) to house our [Onboarding feedback milestones](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/onboarding/onboarding-feedback-milestones) and [360 Impact review cycles](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/impact-reviews).

**When to use:**

- **Onboarding Feedback Milestones:** We have set up Onboarding Feedback Milestones in Lattice to track your new direct report’s progress in onboarding during their first, second, and third month. We want to help teammates succeed by having structured monthly feedback sessions with their managers during their first 3 months, that will open a communication channel for both parties to share feedback and aim for improvement.
- **360 Impact Review Cycles:** Impact reviews will be launched automatically every 6 months, setting everyone up for two review cycles per year. _In these review cycles, you will be asked to give and receive the following reviews in Lattice_:
  - Self-review: reflect on your own contribution to your team and how you’ve made an impact.
  - Peer review: select 2-3 stakeholders who you’ve collaborated with on projects to give feedback on the impact you’ve made and how you’ve lived our values while collaborating.
  - Upwards review: review your manager, how they’ve supported your development, and what they can do to support you more effectively.
  - Your manager reviewing you: your manager will reflect on your contribution to your team and how you’ve made an impact and lived our values.
